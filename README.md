## TypeScript Library

### Installation

```bash
bun add filterql
# or: npm install filterql
```

### Usage

Define a schema for your data and create a FilterQL instance:

```ts
import { FilterQL } from "filterql"

// The schema determines what fields are allowed in the query
const schema = {
  title: { type: "string", alias: "t" },
  year: { type: "number", alias: "y" },
  monitored: { type: "boolean", alias: "m" },
  rating: { type: "number" },
  genre: { type: "string" },
}

const filterql = new FilterQL(schema)

const movies = [
  { title: "The Matrix", year: 1999, monitored: true, rating: 8.7, genre: "Action" },
  { title: "Inception", year: 2010, monitored: true, rating: 8.8, genre: "Thriller" },
  { title: "The Dark Knight", year: 2008, monitored: false, rating: 9.0, genre: "Action" },
]

// Filter movies by genre
const actionMovies = filterql.filter(movies, "genre == Action")

// Field aliases and multiple comparisons
const recentGoodMovies = filterql.filter(movies, "y >= 2008 && rating >= 8.5")

// Filter using boolean shorthand
const monitoredMovies = filterql.filter(movies, "monitored")
```

### A more realistic example

Let's say you're building a CLI tool that fetches some data to be filtered by a query the user provides:

```ts
import { FilterQL } from "filterql"

// data is an array of objects
const data = await (await fetch("https://api.example.com/movies")).json()

const query = process.argv[2] // first argument

const schema = {
  title: { type: "string", alias: "t" },
  year: { type: "number", alias: "y" },
  monitored: { type: "boolean", alias: "m" },
  rating: { type: "number" },
  genre: { type: "string" },
}

const filterql = new FilterQL(schema)
const filteredMovies = filterql.filter(data, query)

console.log(filteredMovies)
```

And then the user might use your CLI tool like this:

```sh
movie-cli '(genre == Action || genre == Comedy) && year >= 2000 && rating >= 8.5'
```

### Queries

The most basic query is a single comparison: `<field> <comparison operator> <value>`

```
title == Interstellar
```

Combine multiple comparisons using logical operators for more complex queries:

```
title == Interstellar && year == 2014
```

Spaces are optional: `title == Interstellar` is equivalent to `title==Interstellar`.

#### Logical Operators

The following logical operators can be used in queries:

- `()` (parentheses for grouping)
- `!` (not)
- `&&` (and)
- `||` (or)

Note that these operators are listed in order of precedence. This is important because many queries will likely require parentheses to do what you want. For example:

`genre == Action || genre == Thriller && rating >= 8.5` means "genre must be Action or, genre must be Thriller and rating must be at least 8.5." This probably isn't what you want.

`(genre == Action || genre == Thriller) && rating >= 8.5` means "genre must be Action or Thriller, and rating must be at least 8.5."

#### Comparison Operators

The following comparison operators can be used in comparisons:

- `==` (equals)
- `!=` (not equals)
- `*=` (contains)
- `^=` (starts with)
- `$=` (ends with)
- `~=` (matches regex)
- `>=` (greater than or equal)
- `<=` (less than or equal)

By default, comparisons are case-sensitive. To make them case-insensitive, prefix the comparison operator with `i`:

```
title i== interstellar
```

#### Boolean Fields

For boolean fields, you can use the field name without any comparison to check for truthiness:

`downloaded` is equivalent to `downloaded == true`

`!downloaded` is equivalent to `!(downloaded == true)`

If you want to be more explicit, in addition to `true` you can use `1`, `yes`, or `y`. In addition to `false`, you can use `0`, `no`, or `n`.

`downloaded == 1`, `downloaded == yes`, `downloaded == y`

`downloaded == 0`, `downloaded == no`, `downloaded == n`

#### Quoted Values

If your comparison value has spaces, you must enclose it in double quotes:

```
title == "The Dark Knight"
```

Inside a quoted value, double quotes must be escaped:

```
title == "A title with \"quotes\""
```

#### Empty Value Checks

Sometimes the data you're filtering can have empty values (`""`, `undefined`, `null`). You can filter for empty values by comparing to an empty string:

Get all entries that _don't_ have a rating:

```
rating == ""
```

Get all entries that have a rating:

```
rating != ""
```

### Schemas

The schema given to the `FilterQL` constructor determines what fields are allowed in queries.

Each field has a type and an (optional) alias.

```ts
const schema = {
  title: { type: "string", alias: "t" },
  year: { type: "number", alias: "y" },
  monitored: { type: "boolean" },
}
```

Field types determine validation behavior:

- `string`: The value must be coercible to a string (this is always the case)
- `number`: The value must be coercible to a number
- `boolean`: The value must be `true`/`1`/`yes`/`y` or `false`/`0`/`no`/`n`

### API Reference

#### `FilterQL` class

```ts
class FilterQL {
  constructor(schema: Schema)
  filter<T extends Record<string | number | symbol, unknown>>(data: T[], query: string): T[]
}
```

#### `parse`

```ts
function parse(query: string, schema: Schema): ASTNode
```

You can use the `parse` function to parse a query string into an AST if you want to do some kind of custom evaluation.

## Language Specification

### Grammar

FilterQL follows this grammar:

```
query := expr
expr := and_expr ( "||" and_expr )*
and_expr := term ( "&&" term )*
term := "!" term | "(" expr ")" | comparison
comparison := field operator value | field
```

### Comparison Operators

#### String Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description        | Example                 |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `==`     | Equals             | `title == "Matrix"`     |
| `!=`     | Not equals         | `title != "Matrix"`     |
| `*=`     | Contains           | `title *= "Matrix"`     |
| `^=`     | Starts with        | `title ^= "The"`        |
| `$=`     | Ends with          | `title $= "Knight"`     |
| `~=`     | Regular expression | `title ~= ".*Matrix.*"` |

#### Numeric Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description           | Example         |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `year >= 2000`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `rating <= 8.0` |

#### Case Sensitivity

- Any comparison operator can be prefixed with `i` to make it case-insensitive: `title i== "matrix"`
- Prefixing a numeric comparison operator with `i` has no effect and is effectively ignored

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description            | Example                                   | Precedence (in order from highest to lowest) |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `()`     | Parentheses (grouping) | `(year >= 2000 && year <= 2010)`          | Highest precedence                           |
| `!`      | NOT                    | `!monitored`                              | Right associative                            |
| `&&`     | AND                    | `monitored && year >= 2000`               | Left associative                             |
| `\|\|`   | OR                     | `genre == "Action" \|\| genre == "Drama"` | Left associative                             |

### Rules/Restrictions

- A field **cannot** contain the following characters: whitespace (` `, `\t`, `\n`, `\r`), reserved token characters (`(`, `)`, `!`, `&`, `\|`, `"`, `=`, `*`, `^`, `$`, `~`, `>`, `<`)
- Fields can be used without a comparison operator: `monitored` is equivalent to `monitored == true`
- Values are either **unquoted** or **quoted**
  - Values requiring spaces are enclosed in double quotes: `"The Matrix"`
  - Double quotes (`"`) are the only valid quotes for values
  - Double quotes inside quoted values are escaped with a backslash: `"a value with \"quotes\""`
    - This is the only supported escape sequence
- An empty string value (`""`) matches empty values (e.g. `""`, `undefined`, `null`): `title == ""`
  - This only works with the `==` and `!=` comparison operators. e.g. `title *= ""` is not an error, but it will never match anything
- The values of `1`/`yes`/`y` (case-insensitive) are coerced to `true`. The field values of `0`/`no`/`n` (case-insensitive) are coerced to `false`
- When a numeric operator is used (`>=`, `<=`), the value **must** be a valid number
- For the `~=` comparison operator, invalid regex patterns do not cause an error and never match
