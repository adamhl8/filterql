## TypeScript Library

### Installation

```bash
bun add filterql
# or: npm install filterql
```

### Usage

Define a schema for your data and create a FilterQL instance:

```ts
import { FilterQL } from "filterql"

// The schema determines what fields are allowed in the query
const schema = {
  title: { type: "string", alias: "t" },
  year: { type: "number", alias: "y" },
  monitored: { type: "boolean", alias: "m" },
  rating: { type: "number" },
  genre: { type: "string" },
}

const filterql = new FilterQL({ schema })

const movies = [
  { title: "The Matrix", year: 1999, monitored: true, rating: 8.7, genre: "Action" },
  { title: "Inception", year: 2010, monitored: true, rating: 8.8, genre: "Thriller" },
  { title: "The Dark Knight", year: 2008, monitored: false, rating: 9.0, genre: "Action" },
]

// Filter movies by genre
const actionMovies = filterql.filter(movies, "genre == Action")

// Field aliases and multiple comparisons
const recentGoodMovies = filterql.filter(movies, "y >= 2008 && rating >= 8.5")

// Sort the filtered data by using the built-in SORT operation
const recentGoodMovies = filterql.filter(movies, "year >= 2008 | SORT rating desc")

// Filter using boolean shorthand
const monitoredMovies = filterql.filter(movies, "monitored")
```

### A more realistic example

Let's say you're building a CLI tool that fetches some data to be filtered by a query the user provides:

```ts
import { FilterQL } from "filterql"

// data is an array of objects
const data = await (await fetch("https://api.example.com/movies")).json()

const query = process.argv[2] // first argument

const schema = {
  title: { type: "string", alias: "t" },
  year: { type: "number", alias: "y" },
  monitored: { type: "boolean", alias: "m" },
  rating: { type: "number" },
  genre: { type: "string" },
}

const filterql = new FilterQL({ schema })
const filteredMovies = filterql.filter(data, query)

console.log(filteredMovies)
```

And then the user might use your CLI tool like this:

```sh
movie-cli '(genre == Action || genre == Comedy) && year >= 2000 && rating >= 8.5'
```

### Queries

The most basic query is a single comparison: `<field> <comparison operator> <value>`

```
title == Interstellar
```

You can also use the alias for a field:

```
t == Interstellar
```

Combine multiple comparisons using logical operators for more complex queries:

```
title == Interstellar && year == 2014
```

#### Logical Operators

The following logical operators can be used in queries:

- `()` (parentheses for grouping)
- `!` (not)
- `&&` (and)
- `||` (or)

> [!TIP]
> Note that these operators are listed in order of precedence. This is important because many queries will likely require parentheses to do what you want.

For example:

`genre == Action || genre == Thriller && rating >= 8.5` means "genre must be Action or, genre must be Thriller and rating must be at least 8.5." This probably isn't what you want.

`(genre == Action || genre == Thriller) && rating >= 8.5` means "genre must be Action or Thriller, and rating must be at least 8.5."

#### Comparison Operators

The following comparison operators can be used in comparisons:

- `==` (equals)
- `!=` (not equals)
- `*=` (contains)
- `^=` (starts with)
- `$=` (ends with)
- `~=` (matches regex)
- `>=` (greater than or equal)
- `<=` (less than or equal)

> [!TIP]
> Comparisons are case-sensitive. To make them case-insensitive, prefix the comparison operator with `i`.

```
title i== interstellar
```

#### Boolean Fields

For boolean fields, you can use the field name without any comparison to check for `true`:

`downloaded` is equivalent to `downloaded == true`

`!downloaded` is equivalent to `!(downloaded == true)`

#### Quoted Values

If your comparison value has spaces, you must enclose it in double quotes:

```
title == "The Dark Knight"
```

Inside a quoted value, double quotes must be escaped:

```
title == "A title with \"quotes\""
```

Values ending with `)` _as part of the value_ (not a closing parenthesis) must be quoted:

```
title == "(a title surrounded by parentheses)"
```

#### Empty Value Checks

Sometimes the data you're filtering might have empty values (`""`, `undefined`, `null`). You can filter for empty values by comparing to an empty string:

Get all entries that _don't_ have a rating:

```
rating == ""
```

Get all entries that have a rating:

```
rating != ""
```

#### Match-All

If you want to get _all_ of the entries, use `*` (the data is not filtered):

```
*
```

This is mainly useful when you don't want to filter the data but want to apply operations to it.

```
* | SORT rating desc
```

### Operations

After filtering, you can apply operations to transform the data: `<filter> | <operation> [arg]...`

```
year >= 2000 | SORT rating desc | LIMIT 10
```

- Operations are applied in the order they are specified.
- The same operation can be applied multiple times.

#### Built-in Operations

There are currently two built-in operations:

- `SORT`: Sorts the data by the specified field.
  - `SORT <field> [direction]`
  - `direction` can be `asc` or `desc` (default: `asc`).
- `LIMIT`: Limits the number of entries returned.
  - `LIMIT <number>`

If you have any suggestions for other operations, please let me know by opening an issue!

> [!TIP]
> You can also define **[custom operations](#custom-operations)**.

### `FilterQL` Class

#### Schemas

The schema given to the `FilterQL` constructor determines what fields are allowed in queries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> FilterQL does not care about extra properties/keys in the _data_.
>
> In other words, a schema's keys can be a subset of the data's keys.

Each field has a `type` and an (optional) `alias`.

```ts
const schema = {
  title: { type: "string", alias: "t" },
  year: { type: "number", alias: "y" },
  monitored: { type: "boolean" },
}

const filterql = new FilterQL({ schema })
```

Field types determine validation behavior:

- `string`: The value must be coercible to a string (this is always the case)
- `number`: The value must be coercible to a number
- `boolean`: The value must be `true` or `false`

> [!NOTE]
> When a comparison value can't be coerced to the field's type, an error is thrown. For example, a query like `year = foo` will cause an error to be thrown.

#### Options

```ts
const filterql = new FilterQL({
  schema,
  options: {
    allowUnknownFields: false,
  },
})
```

The `FilterQL` constructor accepts an optional `options` object with the following properties:

`allowUnknownFields` (default: `false`): By default, an error is thrown if a query contains a field that's not in the schema. If `true`, unknown fields are allowed.

- This could be useful in situations where the schema can't be determined ahead of time. i.e. the keys of the data are unknown or may change.

#### Custom Operations

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at the built-in operations in [src/operation-evaluator/operations.ts](./src/operation-evaluator/operations.ts) to see how they're implemented.

Let's say you want to create a custom operation called `ROUND` that takes a field name as the first argument and rounds the number value of that field.

A query might look something like `year >= 2000 | SORT rating desc | ROUND rating`.

You can define custom operations by providing a `customOperations` object to the `FilterQL` constructor.

- The keys are the names of the custom operations and **must** be all uppercase.
- The values are functions that return the transformed data.

```ts
import type { OperationMap } from "filterql"

const customOperations: OperationMap = {
  ROUND: (data, args, { resolveField }) => {
    const field = resolveField(args[0]) // the first argument might be the alias of the field
    if (!field) throw new Error(`Unknown field '${args[0]}' for operation 'ROUND'`)
    return data.map((item) => Math.round(item[field]))
  },
}

const filterql = new FilterQL({ schema: mySchema, customOperations })
```

Three arguments are provided to a given operation function:

- `data`: The data after its been filtered (and transformed by any previous operations).
- `args`: A string array containing any arguments passed to the operation.
- `operationHelpers`: An object containing the FilterQL instance `schema`, `options`, and a `resolveField` function.
  - The `resolveField` function takes a string and returns the full field name if it exists in the schema. Use it to support field aliases in operations. e.g. `"t" -> "title"` or `"title" -> "title"` (full field name resolves to itself).

Built-in operations can be overridden by providing a custom operation with the same name:

```ts
const customOperations: OperationMap = {
  SORT: (data, args, { resolveField }) => {
    // your custom SORT implementation
  },
}
```

### API Reference

#### `FilterQL`

```ts
class FilterQL {
  constructor({
    schema: Schema,
    options?: FilterQLOptions,
    customOperations?: OperationMap
  })
  filter<T extends Record<string | number | symbol, unknown>>(data: T[], query: string): T[]
}
```

## Language Specification

### Grammar

FilterQL follows this grammar:

```
query := filter ( "|" operation )*
filter := expr
operation := operation_name arg*
expr := and_expr ( "||" and_expr )*
and_expr := term ( "&&" term )*
term := "!" term | "(" expr ")" | comparison
comparison := field operator value | field | "*"
```

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description           | Example                 |
| -------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `==`     | Equals                | `title == Interstellar` |
| `!=`     | Not equals            | `title != "The Matrix"` |
| `*=`     | Contains              | `title *= "Matrix"`     |
| `^=`     | Starts with           | `title ^= The`          |
| `$=`     | Ends with             | `title $= Knight`       |
| `~=`     | Regular expression    | `title ~= ".*Matrix.*"` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `year >= 2000`          |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `rating <= 8.0`         |

Any comparison operator can be prefixed with `i` (used to make a comparison case-insensitive):

```
title i== "the matrix"
```

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description            | Example                               | Precedence (in order from highest to lowest) |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `()`     | Parentheses (grouping) | `(year >= 2000 && year <= 2010)`      | Highest precedence                           |
| `!`      | NOT                    | `!title *= Matrix`                    | Right associative                            |
| `&&`     | AND                    | `monitored && year >= 2000`           | Left associative                             |
| `\|\|`   | OR                     | `genre == Action \|\| genre == Drama` | Left associative                             |

### Match-All

The `*` character can be used in place of a comparison. When evaluated, it _always_ matches.

`* | SORT year`: Matches all entries and then sorts by `year`.

`title == Matrix || * | SORT year`: This is effectively the same as the above query because the `|| *` matches all entries.

### Operations

Operations can be chained after the filter expression using the pipe operator (`|`). Each operation consists of an uppercase operation name followed by zero or more arguments:

```
title == "Matrix" | SORT year
rating >= 8.5 | SORT rating desc | LIMIT 10
```

### Syntax Rules

- Tokens/words in queries are terminated by whitespace (` `, `\t`, `\n`, `\r`)
  - e.g. a query like `title==Matrix` would be tokenized as _one_ token with a value of `"title==Matrix"`
- Queries are terminated by end of input
- Fields can be used without a comparison operator: `monitored` is equivalent to `monitored == true`
- Fields and values can have operators "attached" to them that are automatically split off during tokenization:
  - Fields can have one or more leading operators (`!`, `(`) and trailing operators (`)`) attached. e.g. `!(monitored)` becomes tokens: `["!", "(", "monitored", ")"]`
  - Values can have one or more trailing operators (`)`) attached. e.g. `(title == Matrix)` becomes tokens: `["(", "title", "==", "Matrix", ")"]`
    - As a consequence, values ending with `)` _as part of the value_ must be quoted: `field == "(value)"`
  - This allows for natural syntax like `!(field == value)` without requiring spaces around operators
- Values are either **unquoted** or **quoted**
  - Values requiring whitespace must be enclosed in double quotes: `"The Matrix"`
  - Double quotes (`"`) are the only valid quotes
  - Double quotes inside quoted values are escaped with a backslash (`\"`): `"a value with \"quotes\""`
    - This is the only supported escape sequence
  - Empty quoted values are valid: `""`
- Values are _always_ preceded by a comparison operator, which is how they can be differentiated from fields
- Operation names must be all uppercase

### Implementation

This repository serves as a reference implementation for the language. See the source code for implementation details.
